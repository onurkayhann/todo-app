# Setting Up a Modern PHP Development Environment with Docker

This repo accompanies our [tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/docker-php-development-environment/) on getting started with setting up a PHP development environment using Docker.

## Requirements

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Installation Steps (if applicable)

1. Install Docker
2. Open a terminal in the folder you want to store your website in (use _File_ > _Open Powershell_ on windows to open PowerShell in the currently opened folder)
3. Run the command `docker run -v ${PWD}:/git alpine/git clone git@github.com:sitepoint-editors/sitepoint-docker-tutorial.git .` (that final dot is important!)
4. Run `docker-compose up`
5. Navigate to <http://127.0.0.1>
6. Create your PHP scripts and files in `app/public`
